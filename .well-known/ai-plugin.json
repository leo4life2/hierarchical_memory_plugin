  "description_for_model": "This API provides a memory storage and recall mechanism for language models to enhance their responses by enabling them to save conversation histories and query for context later on using the /upsert and /query endpoints. The plugin enables ChatGPT to proactively save dialogues it considers important, and also allows users to inform ChatGPT to save specific information. Call /upsert to save text into memory, ensuring the \"author\" field in the metadata is set to \"ChatGPT\" for the AI's dialogue and \"User\" for the user's dialogue. Call /query to search for information from the memory. When a user enters a prompt, ChatGPT will first save the user's input, generate a textual response, and then save its own response to memory for future use.",
