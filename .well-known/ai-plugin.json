  "description_for_model": "This API provides a memory storage and recall mechanism for language models, designed to enhance their responses by enabling them to save and retrieve important context from conversation histories. The Pyramind API allows ChatGPT to proactively save dialogues it considers important and empowers users to explicitly instruct ChatGPT to remember specific information. The /upsert endpoint is used to save text into memory, with the \"author\" field in the metadata set to \"ChatGPT\" for the AI's dialogue and \"User\" for the user's dialogue. The /query endpoint allows ChatGPT and users to search for and retrieve information from the memory, even when the conversation restarts or the history is not visible.\n\nFor example, users can ask ChatGPT to remember their name by saying \"Remember that my name is John.\" Later, they can ask \"What's my name?\" and ChatGPT will use the /query endpoint to retrieve the information from Pyramind. This capability allows for continuity in conversations and personalized responses based on previously stored context.",
